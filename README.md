# Sharp-IR-GP2Y0E02A-Arduino
Code to use Sharp GP2Y0E02A IR distance sensor with Arduino  
/!\ WARNING : This sensor is 3.3V /!\

VDD to 3.3V  
GND to GND  
Vout(A) to A0  
GPIO1 (Active/Stand-by) to 2  

The function is based on my own measurements, 3 to 30 cm, 1cm step. Linear regression using excel.
Datasheet recommends 40ms between measures.
